### 🚀 **About Me**
I’m a **software engineer and AI enthusiast** passionate about designing scalable, reliable systems that bridge **cloud engineering and applied machine learning**.  
I love building products that make an impact — from **real-time AI assistants** to **data pipelines that move millions of records** efficiently.

💡 My journey so far has taken me from  
➡️ building distributed microservices at **Wipro**,  
➡️ to engineering large-scale reliability frameworks at **Amazon**,  
➡️ to developing cloud-native AI applications that combine **LLMs, real-time streaming, and serverless design**.

### ⚙️ **What I’m Working On**
- 🌥️ Building **serverless data pipelines** with AWS Kinesis, Glue, and Step Functions  
- 🤖 Exploring **LLM safety and AI-driven automation** using Gemini and AWS Bedrock  
- 🧠 Researching **AI ethics and reliability** as part of my ASU coursework  
- 🛠️ Constantly improving my craft in **distributed systems and MLOps**

### 🧩 **Projects**
🔹 **[TherapyAI](#)** – Real-time counseling simulator using Gemini, Node.js, and WebSockets  
> Built a safe, scalable AI therapy simulator (~300 ms latency) and automated persona creation pipeline on Google Cloud.  

🔹 **[AI-Powered Knowledge Base](#)** – Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using AWS & OpenAI  
> Implemented a Go + React app integrating Bedrock embeddings for real-time semantic search and summarization.  

🔹 **[Real-Time ETL Pipeline](#)** – Serverless AWS data platform for weather analytics  
> Streamed 2,800+ records/min using Kinesis → Glue → S3 (Parquet) with Athena queries and SageMaker anomaly detection.
